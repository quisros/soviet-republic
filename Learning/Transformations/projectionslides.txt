Parallel projection

1. Orthographic projection
- multiviews with true size/shape for parallel lines
- for projection on z=0 plane, projection matrix is 4x4 identity with 3rd diagonal element as 0

2. Axonometric projection
- U is 3x3 identity matrix plus a full row of 1s added at bottom
- T is the transformation matrix to bring object into required posn (i.e. axonometric projection)
- then T*U gives matrix which is used to calc foreshortening ratios for each principal axis
- trimetric, dimetric and isometric depending on how many unique foreshortening ratios

3. Oblique projection
- projectors mutually parallel but not perpendicular to plane of projection
- orthogonally project given point onto projection plane
- and join given point with projection plane via the projection line

4. Perspective projection
- projectors converge at finite centre of projection
- non-uniform foreshortening
- shape not preserved, but view is natural
- vanishing point lies equal distance on opposite side of projection plane as center of projection
- depending on which axis COP is on, required coeff is put in corresp. posn in 4th row of matrix
