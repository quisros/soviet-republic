Fragment interpolation occurs in the fragment shader. 

When rendering an object, the rasterization stage usually results 
in a lot more fragments than vertices originally specified. 
The rasterizer then determines the positions of each of those fragments 
based on where they reside on the triangle shape.

Based on these positions, it interpolates all the fragment shader's input variables. 
Say for example we have a line where the upper point has a green color 
and the lower point a blue color. If the fragment shader is run at a 
fragment that resides around a position at 70% of the line, 
its resulting color input attribute would then be a linear combination 
of green and blue; to be more precise: 30% blue and 70% green.

Fragment interpolation is applied to all the fragment shader's input attributes.
